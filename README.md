This repository contains the configuration and content of my personal website. You can see the live copy at www.clemenslutz.com.

The index page is constructed as a Pelican [static page](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html#pages) using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), Python's [Markdown extensions](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html), and [Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io).
The layout is inspired by Asterios Katsifodimos' very nice [website](https://github.com/asteriosk/web).
